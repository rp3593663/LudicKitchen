With design cues that stay true to Ludic and room for future customisation, this is a product built to last and grow with the ecosystem.</p>",

These are shared with the manufacturer, followed by R&D through maquette development & fit testing. A PLA prototype helps lock proportions before finalising fit & creating a master mould in UK 8. From there, EVA prototypes are developed, fit is refined further, moulds are opened across all sizes, colorways are tested, & the product moves into final production.</p>",

Comfort, grip, breathability, and visual language are developed together, seen in the dual-material construction, wave-pattern footbed, side air vents, and elastic woven back straps. Each element connects back to Ludic's design philosophy, making the clogs adaptable, customisable, and part of a larger ecosystem rather than a usual one-off slip-on.</p>",
